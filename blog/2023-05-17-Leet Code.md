This is a tropological sort kind of problem, we can't use union find because we would union things all together.
Instead, we should just care about nodes that aren't reachable from other nodes.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, List<List<Integer>> edges) {
        boolean[] pointed = new boolean[n];
        for(List<Integer> edge : edges){
            pointed[edge.get(1)] = true; // this node can be reached from other nodes
        }
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i ++){
            // any nodes cant be reached from other nodes we just add into res
            if(!pointed[i]) res.add(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
