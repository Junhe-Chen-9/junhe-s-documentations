Little busy, but this is just as much a problem as reverse linkedlist. 

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        // base case 
        if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode last = head.next; // this would be the new head, because we have to reverse curr and next
        head.next = swapPairs(head.next.next); // the head is now the curr sections last node and it suppose to connect to the rest of the list
        last.next = head; // set the new head to connect to the curr head which is tail of the curr section
        return last;
    }
}
```
