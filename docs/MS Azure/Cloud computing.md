### Introduction

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet.

### What is cloud computing?

Just like how you shop for a physical computer and run the software, cloud computing have different specs you can choose and run your applications. Instead maitaining the hardware, cloud computer everthing is running at datacenter.

### major offering

- Compute power

This is how much processing power, this can be ram and processor, but in practice, as your application scales, you will need to improve your local system, with cloud computing, you can add compute power anytime you needed. Saving cost from buying hardware to be future proven, instead you are only paying what you needed and using at the moment.

- storage

This is volume, how much data you can store, with traditional hardware, you will likely to expand storage as your end user expand, as well as seperate drive for data safety, with cloud computing you can request more as you needed, cloud computing offered company keeps your data safe and software updated, as well as making sure system runs 24/7.

### Shared responsibility model

#### Traditional corporate datacenter

IT department is maintaining the pysical space, ensuring security and maintaining and replacing server parts if anything needed attentions. The responsibility is on IT department to keep on all system patched and running smoothingly.

#### shared responsibility model

The responsibility is now between the cloud provider and consumer. Cloud provider maintains everthing that is physical while consumer responsible for the data and information stored within the cloud. In addition consumer is also responsible for access security managing all the secrets and access.

#### Some acronym

- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
  Most responsibility is at consumer, cloud provider manage only the infrastructures.
- platform as a service (PaaS)
  Middle ground, responsibility is distributed evenly between cloud provider and consumer.
- software as a service (SaaS)
  Most responsibility on the cloud provider
