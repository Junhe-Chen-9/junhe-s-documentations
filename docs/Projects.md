### Machine Learning ###
1. **[Redwine Quality Prediction](https://github.com/Junhe-Chen-9/redwine-quality-prediction)**
    - Quality wine is important as world's wine consumption is over 1.1 billion gallons in 2021 already. It is hard to value a wine based on human quality assessment. We can use the features of a wine to accurately predict the quality score of a wine using algorithms. In this project we are going to build prediction model for the red wine based on 10 features and 4 strongest correlation features. 
    - LogisticRegression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVC, Neural Network models used.
    - Cross Validation to avoid overfitting the model.

### React ###
1. **[Bio Link Tree](https://github.com/Junhe-Chen-9/biolinksite)**
    - A simple link tree.
2. **[Reactive Portfolio](https://github.com/Junhe-Chen-9/reactive-portfolio-jc)**
    - Reactive portfolio with contact form and resume.
